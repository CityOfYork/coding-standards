# CYC Development Team coding standards
This repository contains a coding standards wiki which outlines our styles and standards.

It also contains sample projects for our core languages (C#, JavaScript, TypeScript) and frameworks (Angular, React, MVC) etc

See our [wiki](https://github.com/CityOfYork/coding-standards/wiki) for documents or pull the codebase to build and run sample projects.
